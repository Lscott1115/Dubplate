                            <p class="linespace">Bad Bunny fans with tickets purchased through Ticketmaster were left stranded outside his sold-out concert in Mexico City Friday 
                                night (December 9) when concert staff claimed attendees were passing counterfeit tickets. CNN en Español report that 
                                hundreds of fans were denied entry to the venue, the 80,000-plus capacity Estadio Azteca, and images from the concert on social media depicted large 
                                swaths of empty seats at the sold-out show.</p>
                            <p class="linespace">In a statement posted to the verified Ticketmaster Mexico account, the company apologized to ticketholders, claiming an “unprecedented” 
                                number of false tickets overwhelmed its systems, legitimate ticket-holders were denied entry, and that refunds would be provided to ticketholders if their 
                                electronic records showed they were unable to enter the stadium. Estadio Azteca issued its own statement, stating that Ticketmaster's system reported tickets 
                                that were duplicated or falsified, and to “guarantee the safety” of attendees, all of those tickets were canceled. In its statement, Ticketmaster said it had 
                                contacted PROFECO, Mexico's consumer protection agency, and promised to assist law enforcement in preventing ticket fraud, but offered no details of how legitimate 
                                ticketholders could prevent being denied entry to future shows.</p>

                            <p class="linespace">Set your calendars. The annual Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival (more commonly referred to by the shorthand Coachella) has been confirmed for April 2023. The annual multi-day outdoor 
                                event is almost always one of the most highly anticipated musical events of the year. From stylish fashions, and a wide array of food options to unique visual art installations, there are so many things to do 
                                on the grounds of the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California.</p>
                            <p class="linespace">Last year's lineup wasn't announced until mid-January, so it is safe to assume we can expect an announcement around that same time, which gives attendees a few weeks to gather up their 
                                coins to snap a ticket. Additionally, festival promoter Paul Tollett ensures R&B singer Frank Ocean is still slated to be one of the following year's headliners after the 2020 festival was canceled due to COVID.</p>
